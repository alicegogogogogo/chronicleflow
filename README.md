# ChronicleFlow

ChronicleFlow is a small backend for durable workflow orchestration. It stores
workflow definitions, execution state, and an append-only event history in
SQLite so an execution can be inspected and replayed deterministically.

The initial release intentionally supports a compact public contract:

- workflows are directed acyclic graphs of `task` and `condition` nodes;
- executions advance one ready task at a time, evaluating conditions and
  skipping unmatched branches automatically;
- every state transition is appended to the execution event stream;
- replay rebuilds execution state from the recorded events;
- duplicate commands with the same idempotency key return the original result.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- no third-party runtime dependencies

## Run the service

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m chronicleflow.server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --database chronicleflow.db
```

The process prints `ChronicleFlow listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080` after it
has bound the port.

## HTTP API

All request and response bodies are JSON. Unknown fields are rejected.

### Health

```http
GET /health
```

Returns `{"status":"ok"}`.

### Create a workflow

```http
POST /workflows
Idempotency-Key: workflow-request-1

{
  "id": "order-flow",
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "reserve", "kind": "task", "depends_on": []},
    {"id": "charge", "kind": "task", "depends_on": ["reserve"]}
  ]
}
```

Returns HTTP 201 with the stored workflow. Node identifiers must be unique,
dependencies must exist, and cycles are rejected.

Besides `task`, a node may have `kind` set to `condition`:

```json
{"id": "is_vip", "kind": "condition", "depends_on": ["reserve"], "path": "customer.vip", "equals": true}
```

`path` is a non-empty dot-separated path into the execution input and `equals`
is a JSON scalar (string, number, boolean, or null). A condition is evaluated
automatically once its dependencies complete: the input value at `path` is
compared with `equals` by JSON type and value, and a missing path evaluates to
`false`.

A task may carry an optional `run_if` guard:

```json
{"id": "expedite", "kind": "task", "depends_on": ["is_vip"], "run_if": {"condition_id": "is_vip", "expected": true}}
```

`condition_id` must reference a `condition` node that is also listed in the
task's `depends_on`. When the condition's result differs from `expected`, the
task is marked as skipped: it receives no output and still satisfies the
dependencies of its successors.

### Start an execution

```http
POST /executions
Idempotency-Key: execution-request-1

{"id":"run-1","workflow_id":"order-flow","input":{"order_id":"o-7"}}
```

Returns HTTP 201. The execution starts in `running` state.

### Inspect an execution

```http
GET /executions/run-1
GET /executions/run-1/events
```

The first endpoint returns the materialized state. The second returns the
ordered event stream.

### Complete the next ready node

```http
POST /executions/run-1/advance
Idempotency-Key: advance-request-1

{"output":{"reservation_id":"r-9"}}
```

The lexicographically first ready task is completed. The response contains the
updated execution. Before that, each call first evaluates all ready conditions
in deterministic order and skips tasks whose `run_if` does not match; if this
automatic processing finishes the execution, the current state is returned and
the submitted output is not consumed. When every node is completed or skipped,
the status becomes `completed`.

Execution state includes `completed_nodes` (which also lists evaluated
conditions), `skipped_nodes`, `condition_results`, and `outputs`. Each
condition evaluation appends a `condition_evaluated` event and each skip a
`node_skipped` event to the execution stream.

### Replay

```http
POST /executions/run-1/replay
```

Rebuilds state solely from the execution event stream and compares it with the
stored materialized state. A successful response contains `consistent: true`
and the rebuilt execution.

## Errors

Errors use this shape:

```json
{"error":{"code":"validation_error","message":"human readable detail"}}
```

Validation errors return 400, missing resources return 404, and conflicts
return 409.

## Tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
